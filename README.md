# Space Wars!

This is an Android App made for a mobile application development class I took in college. Its a small space shooter game, very basic and very buggy. Keep in mind this was done in like 20 hours in collaboration with [Josh Nasiatka](https://github.com/joshuanasiatka).

Also have a two part YouTube video explaining the code, and a game demo.
